MISMIP test case
========
This directory contains two Python scripts for running the MISMIP experiments on a fixed domain on a linearly tilted bed topography.
(WHL: Just one python script for now)
To run the experiment, enter the following on a terminal command line:

For a serial job: ./mismipInit.py

For a parallel job: ./mismipInit.py -m number_of_processors, for example:

./mismipInit.py -m 8 

... will run the test case on 8 processors.

Execute: ./mismipInit.py --help
for a list of all options available.

To run with a specific configuration file: ./mismipInit.py -c mismip_config_filename

If no config file is specified, the default is mismipInit.config.

To run with a specific executable: ./mismipInit.py -e cism_executable_name

If no executable is specified, the default is cism_driver.
You can either copy the cism_driver executable to this directory or create a link, e.g.:

ln -s ../../../builds/mac-gnu/cism_driver/cism_driver cism_driver

The default configuration file is set to use the higher-order Glissade dycore.
The current option is the DIVA solver (which_ho_approx = 3), based on Goldberg (2011).

The script performs the following steps:
1. Create a netCDF input file for CISM.
2. Run CISM, creating a netCDF output file.

PREREQUISITES:
In order to use the mismip.py script, you will need to have Python and one of the
following Python modules installed:
Scientific.IO.NetCDF, netCDF4, or pycdf

To view the results use ncview or another utility for viewing netCDF files.
