  <!-- Each namelist variable is defined in an <entry> element.  The
     content of the element is the documentation of how the variable is
     used.  Other elements  are:
     id
          The variable's name.  *** N.B. *** The name must be lower case.
          The module convert all namelist variable names to lower case
          since Fortran is case insensitive.
     type
          An abbreviation of the fortran declaration for the variable.
	  Valid declarations are:
             char, integer, logical, real
	  Any of these types may be followed by a comma separated list of
	  integers enclosed in parenthesis to indicate an array.
	  The current namelist validation code only distinquishes between
	  string and non-string types.
     category
          A category assigned for organizing the documentation.
     group
          The namelist group that the variable is declared in.
     valid_values
          This is an optional attribute that is mainly useful for variables
          that have only a small number of allowed values.
